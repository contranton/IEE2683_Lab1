Issue 1
-------
Problem:
- Basic client script doesn't work
Hypotheses:
- Are localhosts the same? Maybe Live Share is masking the ocp server
- Maybe google drive file stream is messing things up
Analysis:
- Wireshark showed outbound and inbound connections
  from the 4840 port when running client.connect(), 
  therefore the networking works just fine
Solved:
- Issue was with the query; the names were wrong!
- We were querying "Proceso Tanques" instead of "Proceso Tanques"
- Besides, the exception catch was not properly done, and the initial testing missed 
  out on checking that objectsNode was indeed defined even though h1 wasn't
